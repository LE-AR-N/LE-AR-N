# ROS & MoveIt in the design environment

Introduction to ROS, topics, services, actions.

Basic inter-process communication via ROS nodes. Reproducible ROS environments with Docker.

Robot planning: forward and inverse kinematic functions, cartesian and kinematic planning. MoveIt integration in the parametric design environment.

## Examples

Make sure you start (`compose up`) the container with a UR3e planner for these examples.

## Preparation for next lecture

* No coding assignment, but:
* **Use and experiment** with example 420:
  * To search paths for more than one part
  * To add the current part as attached collision mesh
* **Pair and Answer** the following two questions:
  * What was the most important thing you learned today?
  * What important question(s) remain(s) unanswered?
